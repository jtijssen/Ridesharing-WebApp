# Ridesharing-WebApp

This is a ridesharing Web Application created as a final assignment for my Comp20: Web Programming class, taught by Ming Chow.

The front end of this program is in JavaScript and HTML.
The backend of the program is in Node.js, JavaScript, and MongoDB deployed through Heroku.

Additionally, to generate the map, I used the google maps API.
